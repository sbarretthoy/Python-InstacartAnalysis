# Python-InstacartAnalysis
Analysis of Instacart sales using Python as part of CareerFoundry program.

# Context

Instacart is an online grocery store that operated through an app. They are considering target marketing and would like to uncover informtion about their sales patterns and customers. The goal is to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see if they have an effect on sales. My role as an analyst is to perform exploratory analysis to derive insights and suggest strategies to show instacart what this targeted marketing might look like and ensure they target the correct customer profiles with appropriate marketing. 

# Key Questions

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
    ○ What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
    ○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
    ○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
    ○ Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
      habits?
    ○ What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
      Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
    ○ What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
      profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

# Data

Open source data from instacart was used throughout this analysis as well as a fabricated customers dataset created by CareerFoundry for the purposes of this project.
